# The momentfit package

This is the newest and best maintained package for GMM and GEL
estimation. Will add some intro shortly.

For now, the development page is on Rforge. Follow the link for the most recent version: https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/gmm/

I am curently working on adding the most recent tools (test and inference) for models with weak and or many instruments.
